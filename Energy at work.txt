Not long ago, I was chatting with my friend, and eventually, we ended up talking about the ways we handle our stress during the day. I told my friend that journaling is one of the most effective ways for me to get rid of the stress. Every night writing down my thoughts and feelings really helps me have a lighter mind and to view things from a different and nicer angle. It gives me the opportunity to go through with my feelings rather than stuffing them inside, which in most cases leads to a decrease of my anxiety level.

On the other side, my friend said that keeping fit has been the greatest source of her relief, and she stated that any activity, even a simple brisk walk, would work just fine. An energetic activity helps her to let the pressure go and take her thoughts away from the negative ones.

Looking at our talk, I would tell people to mix up both the arts in order to get rid of stress in an efficient way. Writing makes one comprehend their feelings better whereas exercising enables a person to get rid of the stored-up energy. When these two are combined, they become a perfect balance for one's mind and body, thereby making it easier to encounter stressful situations.
