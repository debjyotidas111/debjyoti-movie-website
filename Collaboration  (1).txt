To solve invoice discrepancies I would deploy a more structured and centralized approval workflow powered by Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and Power Automate. SharePoint will be used as a safe repository for filing the invoice details uploaded by the vendors and Teams will be the place for the flow of communication. Power Automate will bring the function of automated notifications and real-time tracking, which will reduce the amount of manual work. 

Step 1: Vendors fill in a secure SharePoint form to submit their invoices.Step 2: Power Automate procures the invoice to procurement and finance for review and shows a chain of command through each approval stage.Step 3: Notifications of Teams keep stakeholders informed of actions to be taken thus, allowing timely processing.Step 4: All teams (procurement, AP, finance, vendor) can get the latest invoice status via a shared dashboard in real time.

This process improves the traceability and responsibility by enumerating a digital audit trail and, at the same time, getting rid of the practice of using emails or spreadsheets to keep the records and increasing the efficiency of organizations like a “Retail Giant” or “Global Bank” to help them stay away from late payments.
