One of the top executive actions which I follow in my everyday routine to build up my executive presence is structured communication through intentional pauses and clarity. Before crucial discussions or meetings, I jot down the main ideas I want to deliver, and then I rehearse my presentation with confidence and composure. Also, I take an active role in listening to the others and so I always stop and think before answering as well as try to find the right words that are brief and powerful rather than being long and tiring.

This is indeed a great initiative on my part which enables me to portray the required elements of executive presence, i.e., confidence, insight, and professionalism. By speaking in a focused and calm manner I allow my peers and other stakeholders to grasp my point clearly and also they get to feel valued. As a result, it minimizes the chances for misunderstanding and trust is also built because my answers are perceived as well-thought-out and respectful. On a long-term basis, this consistent approach enhances my influence over decisions and I can have a collaborative relationship with both internal and external stakeholders.
