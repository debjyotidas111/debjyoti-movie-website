Not long ago, I had a conversation with a woman I bumped into at the local café, and she shared her entire life story with me. I found it quite interesting when she was asked about what gives her the most pleasure nowadays, she laughed and mentioned that it is being with her grandchildren. In addition, she told that nothing was better than their laughter to give her life and a feeling of mission every day making her brain work.

Anyway, she was willing to confess that it wasn’t all that sunshine and roses for her. The most painful moment that she recounted was when she lost her job without any prior notice after she had been working for the same company for more than ten years. She explained how it was hard to promote the new and better version of herself especially when she had to support her family not only financially but also emotionally and psychologically.

From that hardship, she learned a valuable lesson: resilience matters more than circumstances. She told me that setbacks can be a chance to reinvent yourself rather than an ending. What I learned from her is the importance of hope and adaptability during uncertain times.
