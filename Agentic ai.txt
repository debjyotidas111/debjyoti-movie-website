Agentic AI implementation in enterprises is a great range of risks, such as those related to the operations that might be affected by a failure of the system, ethical problems that might arise due to biased thoughts or unfair decisions, compliance risks. The best governance practices include the characteristics of accountability, providing explanation for the decision process, and the existence of evidence of robust audit trails. Risk-mitigating methods range from the use of human-in-the-loop supervision, continuous monitoring, utilization of bias detection tools, and fail-safe mechanisms to stop the occurrence of any negative consequences. Compliance with regulations should be coherent with frameworks such as GDPR, ISO AI standards, and local AI governance guidelines, which provide for the legal use of data and the ethical deployment. For instance, a Retail Giant successfully integrated Agentic AI in inventory management by maintaining human review checkpoints and regular compliance audits, resulting in improved efficiency without compromising ethical standards.
