My onboarding experience at Genpact has been smooth and positive. I greatly appreciate the interactions with my managers and colleagues, the clarity provided on company policies, and the availability of useful learning modules on the Gnome platform.

One area of improvement, however, is the welcome kit. Apart from the laptop and headset, no Genpact-branded merchandise was provided. As a global organization, offering a welcome kit with items such as a diary, water bottle, or coffee mug would not only enhance the onboarding experience but also help new employees feel more connected to the company culture.

I believe this small addition would go a long way in strengthening the sense of pride and belonging among new hires.
